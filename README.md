# JavaScript Rock-Paper-Scissors Project

## I'm going to write a simple rock paper scissors game in JavaScript that returns "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors"

### The lessons that i've learned in this project:

1. Be patient and don't rush the process of getting the solution right away.

2. Break the problem into small problems that you're comfortable solving. That way, you don't even realize that you've solved the big problem by solving those subproblems.

### The Things that i need to improve on:

- I need to further enhance my problem solving skills in the upcoming projects of the curriculum

- I planned the whole problem instead of writing it in pseudocode. So, i didn't have the opportunity to actively learn how to pseudocode problems in this project.
